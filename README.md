 # Windows 11 Clone

## Overview
This project is a **front-end clone of the Windows 11 desktop interface**, created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It visually replicates the Windows 11 experience including the taskbar, start menu, and desktop look.

## Features
- Desktop-style layout resembling Windows 11
- Start menu and taskbar UI recreated with HTML/CSS
- Icons and UI components aligned to Windows 11 style
- Fully responsive layout
- Smooth interactions (on hover, click, etc.)

## How It Works
The layout is divided into structured containers:
- A fixed **taskbar** at the bottom mimics the real one
- A **start menu** opens when the start button is clicked (if implemented)
- **Icons** and UI elements are styled to match Windows 11
- Interactions are handled using JavaScript (like toggling menus or animations)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To build the structure of the Windows-like desktop and elements  
- **CSS**: To replicate Windows 11 styling and layout  
- **JavaScript**: To handle UI interactivity (like button clicks or effects)
